I first needed to access the lab directory. `The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command was 4 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. Then the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTest` command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.
