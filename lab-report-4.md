Then the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTest` command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.

# Step 7

The command `vim ListExamples.java` was 4 up in the history like before. Once in the vim editor, I used my shortcuts to quickly edit the file in order to fix it.
